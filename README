eBeam kernel module v0.9

Compilation :

Install the tools needed to compile kernel modules, see your linux
distribution's documentation.

Unpack the ebeam archive, and :

#>cd ebeam-0.9
#>make


Loading the kernel module :

Plug the ebeam device.

ebeam devices are currently handled by the HID generic usb driver.
Until upstream inclusion, you'll need to manually unbind
the device from usbhid before inserting the module.

#>lsusb

#>echo -n "4-2:1.0" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind

#>insmod ebeam.ko

Check your log, you should see something like this :

input: USB eBeam 2650:1311 as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.2/usb4/4-2/4-2:1.0/input/12

At this stage, the driver is in uncalibrated mode, sending raw coordinates
that aren't even remotly matching screen ones. However, X evdev driver catch it, and
you can play with your stylus, this should make your screen mouse pointer move.

Now, go check ebeam_tools.
